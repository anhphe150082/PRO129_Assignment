Problems1: You are given a string  consisting of numeric digits (0-9) and Latin alphabetic characters ('a'-'z') only.
Your task is to sort the string but it must be sorted in a unique manner because here even characters or digits have higher priority than odd characters or digits. Although, as usual, other characters or digits have the same priority level. Also, digits have higher priority than characters.
For example : 0>1, 0>5, a>b, 1>a, 3>1, d>b
